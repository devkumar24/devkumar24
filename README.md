##### I'm a Data Scientist, who is passionate about creating a solution of computer vision tasks, and interested only in datasets, creating technology to elevate people and building more and more communities, and I love to explore data. Technology I love to work in TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, SQL. I have solved around 25 datasets from Kaggle, and now I am started contributing to Kaggle Competition. Apart from the field of Data Science, I'm interested in Front-end Web Development(HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Not only does technology inspire me, but I am a lover of nature :evergreen_tree: and space :rocket: :milky_way: . I used to read about space technologies and love to travel places where we won't require electronic gadgets.
